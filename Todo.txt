Live Data

* Visualizing raw data streams (both simple sensors and audio data)
* Visualizing features.

Prediction

* Way to do real-time prediction on the computer.
* Visualizing predictions.

Training / Model Management

Saving and loading the model.
To start: only allow loading of the model if the pipeline specified in code still matches the pipeline stored in the model (otherwise, need to retrain the model from the training data).
Notice of training, estimate of time it will take, and ability to cancel.
Ability to specify percentage of training data to use.

Data Management

Way to visualize training data.
Ways to clean training data:
	⁃	relabeling samples
	⁃	deleting samples
	⁃	editing samples

Documentation

Advice on which models are good for what: e.g. which ones are slow to train, which ones are efficient at run-time, etc.

Arduino

SerialStream class (to load GRT models over Serial).
Arduino example(s) that can accept user.h files from the computer (and load associated models).
(Does the model data include information about the pipeline, e.g. pre-processing and feature extraction?)
